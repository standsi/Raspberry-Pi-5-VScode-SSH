Several additional topics came up during the review of this article that might be of interest.

1. How well does VSCode remote work with older Pi's like the 4, 3 and even Zero?
2. Does Docker run on the Pi 5 and can it be used with VSCode Dev Containers?  If so, is that even useful?

### VSCode Remote Dev with older Raspberry Pi's




----------

all images were lite, pi 4 and 3 were 64 bit of the latest OS available for that device, zero 2w was 32 bit

pi 4,4GB, ethernet direct, see htop image, ethernet name resolution was slow (5 secs to start pinging google)

pi 3, 1GB, ethernet direct, also slow name resolution, see htop image
